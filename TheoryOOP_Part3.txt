different between abstract & interface:
- abstract describe a object, interface describe a group of method
- access specification of:
+ abstract are: default/protected/public 
+ interface is only: public

Multiple inheritance in java appear inheritance in the interface
-> One interface can extends from many others interface.
Note: One class only extends from one class

Final use to constant variables, can not override it.
Final Class prevent use inheritance
Abstract and Final never use together

Static use to define static member in a class. Exmaple: Math.PI, Math.sqrt(5),...
Static doesn't depend on object, class depend on object
Static define block code and In static block only use static variables
Static run when we use any static components in our code.
Block static only run one time
